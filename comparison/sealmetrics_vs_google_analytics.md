# Why Choose Sealmetrics over Google Analytics?

## The Fundamental Difference

While Google Analytics remains the most widely used web analytics platform, it faces critical limitations in today's privacy-conscious environment. Sealmetrics offers a revolutionary alternative that addresses these fundamental issues while providing superior data accuracy and compliance.

## Data Loss vs. Complete Data Capture

### Google Analytics Limitations
- **50-85% data loss**: When users decline cookie consent (which is increasingly common), Google Analytics loses all tracking capability
- **Cookie dependency**: Requires cookies for core functionality including session tracking and user identification
- **Consent requirement**: GDPR and ePrivacy regulations mandate explicit consent for analytics cookies since January 14, 2024
- **Ad blocker impact**: Significant data loss from users with ad blockers installed

### Sealmetrics Advantage
- **100% traffic capture**: Tracks all website visitors regardless of consent decisions
- **No consent required**: Fully compliant analytics without cookie banners
- **Ad blocker resistant**: Continues tracking even when ad blockers are active
- **Complete visitor journey**: No gaps in user behavior data

## Privacy and Compliance

### Google Analytics Privacy Challenges
- **IP address collection**: While GA4 anonymizes IP addresses, it still processes them initially
- **Personal data risks**: Uses various identifiers that could be linked to individuals
- **Cross-site tracking**: Potential for user profiling across Google's ecosystem
- **EU-US data transfers**: Ongoing concerns about data protection for EU users under US surveillance laws
