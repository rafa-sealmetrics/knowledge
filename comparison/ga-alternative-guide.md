# SealMetrics: The Complete Google Analytics Alternative Guide

*Why businesses are switching from Google Analytics to privacy-first analytics that captures 100% of their data without compromising user privacy.*

---

## 🚨 **The Google Analytics Crisis**

Since January 14, 2024, GDPR and ePrivacy regulations have created a **data collection crisis** for businesses using Google Analytics:

### 📉 **The Data Loss Reality**

```
👥 100% Website Visitors
├── 🚫 50-85% decline consent cookies
├── 🚫 30-40% use privacy browsers  
├── 🚫 25-35% block analytics scripts
└── 📊 Only 15-35% actually tracked by GA4

Result: You're making business decisions with 
incomplete data from less than half your audience
```

### ⚖️ **New Legal Requirements**

**GDPR & ePrivacy Directive Updates (2024):**
- ✅ **"Reject All" must be equally prominent** as "Accept All"
- ✅ **Analytics cookies must be "not selected" by default**
- ✅ **Users must expressly accept analytics cookies**
- ❌ **No more "legitimate interest" for analytics**

**The Impact:** Massive drop in consent rates across all industries.

       ↳ Requires personal data & cross-session tracking
```

**SealMetrics Method:**
```
