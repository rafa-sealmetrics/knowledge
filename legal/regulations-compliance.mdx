## Technical Privacy Architecture

### Isolated Hits Tracking System

**Core Privacy Principle:** SealMetrics tracks "isolated hits" rather than user behavior

**How Isolated Hits Work:**

1. Each page view is tracked as an independent event
2. No correlation between different hits from the same user
3. No user journey or behavior pattern analysis
4. No persistent user identification across visits

**Privacy Benefits:**

- No individual user tracking
- No behavioral profiling
- No cross-session correlation
- Complete user anonymity

### Data Collection Methodology

**What We Track (Per Hit):**

- **Timestamp:** When the page view occurred
- **Current URL:** The page being visited
- **Referral URL:** Previous page that led to current visit
- **UTM Parameters:** Campaign attribution data (if present)

**What We Don't Track:**

- User identities or personal information
- Cross-session user behavior
- Individual user journeys
- Personal preferences or characteristics

üìä **Data Minimization Tip:** We collect only the minimum data necessary for meaningful analytics while maintaining complete user anonymity.

## Privacy by Design Implementation

### No Terminal Code Insertion

**Technical Implementation:**

- No cookies stored on user devices
- No localStorage or sessionStorage usage
- No browser fingerprinting techniques
- No persistent identifiers of any kind

**Compliance Advantage:**

- Eliminates need for cookie consent banners
- Works with all browser privacy settings
- Compatible with ad blockers and privacy tools
- Functions in incognito/private browsing mode

### User Agent Processing

**Data Handling:**

- User Agent collected for bot detection and device classification
- **Critical:** User Agent is NOT stored permanently
- Used only for real-time processing and filtering
- No personal identification possible through User Agent alone

**Privacy Protection:**

- Immediate processing without storage
- Aggregate analysis only
- No individual device tracking
- Compliance with data minimization principles

üîí **Privacy Protection Tip:** Our temporary User Agent processing ensures bot filtering without creating persistent user profiles or tracking capabilities.

## Legal Interpretation and Compliance

### ePrivacy Directive Interpretation

**Our Understanding:** Even anonymous page view tracking requires user consent under the strictest interpretation of ePrivacy Directive if it involves individual user tracking.

**SealMetrics Solution:** Our "isolated hits" approach eliminates individual user tracking entirely:

- Each hit is independent and unconnected
- No user behavior analysis across hits
- No individual user profiling
- Complete anonymization by design

**Compliance Result:** No consent required because no individual tracking occurs

### GDPR Article 6 Compliance

**Legal Basis for Processing:**

- **Legitimate Interest (Article 6.1.f):** Website analytics for business improvement
- **No Personal Data Processing:** Our isolated hits approach doesn't process personal data requiring consent
- **Balancing Test Passed:** Minimal privacy impact balanced against legitimate business needs

**Data Protection Principles:**

- **Lawfulness:** Processing based on legitimate interest
- **Fairness:** Transparent and proportionate processing
- **Transparency:** Clear communication of data practices
- **Purpose Limitation:** Data used only for stated analytics purposes
- **Data Minimisation:** Only essential data is collected
- **Storage Limitation:** 25-month maximum retention period

‚öñÔ∏è **Legal Basis Tip:** Our legitimate interest basis is strengthened by the complete absence of personal data processing and individual user tracking.
