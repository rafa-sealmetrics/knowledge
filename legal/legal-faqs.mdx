## Real-Time Tracking and Privacy

### Do you know if SealMetrics works in real-time?

**Default Setting:** Real-time tracking is **turned off by default** to ensure maximum privacy compliance.

**Activation Required:** Users who require real-time data must explicitly activate the Real-time Tracking option in their account settings.

**Privacy Rationale:** Based on the most restrictive privacy regulations globally, web analytics that work with real-time data typically require consent to track. By disabling real-time by default, SealMetrics maintains its consentless approach.

<Tip>
  Only enable real-time tracking if absolutely necessary for your business operations. Most analytics use cases work perfectly with near-real-time data while maintaining stronger privacy compliance.
