# What We Track vs What We Don't

## Our Privacy-First Tracking Philosophy

At Sealmetrics, we operate under a fundamental principle: **if tracking a particular KPI would violate user privacy, we won't track it—even if regulations permit it.** This philosophy drives our data collection decisions and ensures that user privacy is never compromised for business intelligence.

## What We DO Track: The Four-Variable System

SEAL operates on a fundamental isolated hits methodology, collecting only four essential variables per page view:

**3. Current URL**
