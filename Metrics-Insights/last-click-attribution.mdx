## What is Last Click Attribution?

### Definition

**Last Click Attribution** assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the final touchpoint that directly led to the conversion within the same session. This means conversions are attributed solely to the most recent traffic source, UTM parameter, or referrer before the conversion event.

### How It Works

**Attribution Process:**

1. User arrives at your website from a traffic source
2. User navigates through your site (same session)
3. User completes a conversion action
4. Conversion is credited to the last known traffic source from step 1

**Example Scenario:**

```
Day 1: User arrives from Google search → Browses → Leaves
Day 3: User returns via Facebook ad → Browses → Converts
Attribution: 100% credit to Facebook ad (last click)
```

## Legal and Privacy Compliance Rationale

### Why Other Attribution Models Require Consent

**Multi-Touch Attribution Requirements:** Advanced attribution models (Linear, Time Decay, Position-Based, Data-Driven) require:

1. **Cross-Session Tracking:** Following users across multiple visits over time
2. **Personal Identifiers:** Storing user IDs, cookies, or fingerprints to connect sessions
3. **Behavioral Analysis:** Analyzing user journey patterns across channels and devices
4. **Data Persistence:** Maintaining user data for extended attribution windows

### Privacy Regulation Compliance

**European Privacy Laws:** According to the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR:

- **Personal Data Processing:** Any tracking that involves user identifiers constitutes personal data processing
- **Explicit Consent Required:** Personal data processing for marketing attribution requires explicit user consent
- **Legitimate Interest Limitations:** Attribution that tracks behavior doesn't qualify for legitimate interest exemptions

**Specific Legal Requirements:**

- Cross-session tracking requires consent under Article 6 GDPR
- Cookie storage for attribution requires consent under ePrivacy Directive
- Device fingerprinting requires consent under GDPR and national implementations
- Behavioral profiling requires explicit consent under Article 9 GDPR

### SealMetrics' Privacy-First Approach

**Cookieless, Consentless Design:**

- **No Cross-Session Tracking:** Each visit is independent
- **No Personal Identifiers:** No cookies, localStorage, or fingerprinting
- **No User Profiling:** No behavioral analysis across time
- **No Consent Required:** Analytics operation without personal data collection

**Legal Benefits:**

- No cookie consent banners needed for analytics
- Simplified privacy policy requirements
- Reduced GDPR compliance complexity
- Lower data protection obligations

## Attribution Window and Scope

### Single-Session Attribution

**Session Definition:** In SealMetrics, attribution occurs within the context of a single user session:

- **Session Start:** User arrives from external source
- **Session Continuation:** Internal navigation within your website
- **Session End:** User leaves, closes browser, or exceeds inactivity timeout
- **Attribution Scope:** Only within this single session boundary

### Traffic Source Persistence

**How Last Click Works in Practice:**

**Scenario 1: Single Session, Single Source**

```
User Journey: Google Search → Landing Page → Product Page → Conversion
Attribution: 100% to Google Search (SEO)
```

**Scenario 2: Single Session, Multiple Internal Pages**

```
User Journey: Facebook → Homepage → About → Products → Conversion
Attribution: 100% to Facebook (Social)
```

**Scenario 3: Cross-Session Journey (Not Tracked)**

```
Day 1: Google Search → Browse → Leave
Day 2: Direct Visit → Browse → Leave  
Day 3: Email Link → Conversion
Attribution: 100% to Email (only last session tracked)
```

## Comparison with Other Attribution Models

### Traditional Multi-Touch Models

**Linear Attribution:**

- Credits all touchpoints equally across customer journey
- **Requires:** Cross-session tracking and user identification
- **Privacy Impact:** Needs consent for personal data processing

**Time Decay Attribution:**

- Gives more credit to touchpoints closer to conversion
- **Requires:** Temporal user behavior tracking
- **Privacy Impact:** Requires consent for behavioral analysis

**Position-Based Attribution:**

- Splits credit between first touch, last touch, and middle touchpoints
- **Requires:** Complete customer journey tracking
- **Privacy Impact:** Needs consent for comprehensive user profiling

**Data-Driven Attribution:**

- Uses machine learning to assign credit based on historical patterns
- **Requires:** Extensive user behavior data collection
- **Privacy Impact:** Requires consent for advanced behavioral profiling

## Practical Implications

### What Last Click Attribution Tells You

**Reliable Insights:**

- **Direct Channel Performance:** Which channels drive immediate conversions
- **Campaign Effectiveness:** How campaigns perform in driving same-session conversions
- **Landing Page Optimization:** Which entry points lead to conversions
- **Source Quality:** Which traffic sources bring ready-to-convert users

**Example Analysis:**

```
Traffic Source Performance (Last Click):
- Google Ads: 100 visits, 15 conversions (15% conversion rate)
- Facebook: 200 visits, 10 conversions (5% conversion rate)
- SEO: 300 visits, 30 conversions (10% conversion rate)

Insight: Google Ads brings the highest-intent traffic
```

### What Last Click Attribution Doesn't Show

**Limitations:**

- **Assist Touchpoints:** Earlier touchpoints in multi-visit journeys
- **Brand Awareness Impact:** How different channels build awareness over time
- **Cross-Device Journeys:** Users switching between devices
- **Long Consideration Cycles:** Extended purchase decision processes

**Multi-Visit Journey Example:**

```
Reality: Google (research) → Facebook (consideration) → Email (conversion)
Last Click View: Email gets 100% credit
Missing: Google and Facebook's role in the journey
```
