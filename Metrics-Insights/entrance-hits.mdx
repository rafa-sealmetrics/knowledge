# How does SealMetrics Calculate Entrances?

Understanding how SealMetrics calculates entrances is crucial for interpreting your analytics data correctly. This guide explains the entrance calculation methodology and how it differs from traditional analytics platforms.

## What is an "Entrance"?

An "Entrance" in SealMetrics represents an entry to your website. Each time a user accesses your site, a new Entrance is recorded. Unlike other analytics systems that may group sessions based on certain criteria, SealMetrics counts each access independently.

### Key Characteristics

- **Independent counting**: Each website access is counted separately
- **No session grouping**: Unlike traditional analytics that group visits into sessions
- **Privacy-friendly approach**: Avoids complex user tracking and profiling
- **Simple methodology**: Straightforward calculation that's easy to understand
- **Transparent metrics**: Clear definition of what constitutes an entrance

## Entrance Calculation Example

For example, if the same user visits your website 3 times within 10 minutes, SealMetrics would record **5 separate entrances**. This differs from traditional analytics platforms that might group these into a single session.

### Practical Scenario

```
User Journey Example:
10:00 AM - User visits homepage from SEO → Entrance #1
10:02 AM - User returns from Google Ads → Entrance #2  
10:09 AM - User comes back from Newsletter → Entrance #3

Traditional Analytics: 1 session with 3 page views
SealMetrics: 3 entrances with 3 page views.
```

## Difference between "Visits" in GA4 and "Entrances" in SealMetrics

### Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Approach

- **Session-based**: Groups multiple page views into sessions
- **Time-based boundaries**: Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Campaign-based boundaries**: New campaigns can start new sessions
- **Complex logic**: Multiple factors determine session boundaries
- **User identification**: Relies on cookies and user IDs for session continuity

### SealMetrics Approach

- **Entrance-based**: Each website access is an individual entrance
- **No time boundaries**: Time gaps don't affect entrance counting
- **No session grouping**: Every access is independent
- **Simple logic**: Clear, straightforward calculation
- **Privacy-first**: No need for complex user identification

### Comparison Table

| Metric                   | GA4                          | SealMetrics                  |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **Methodology**          | Session-based grouping       | Individual entrance counting |
| **Privacy**              | Requires cookies/user ID     | Cookie-free operation        |
| **Complexity**           | Complex session logic        | Simple access counting       |
| **Time boundaries**      | 30-minute inactivity timeout | No time-based grouping       |
| **Multi-visit handling** | Groups into sessions         | Counts each access           |

## Difference between "Entrances" and "Pageviews" in SealMetrics

### Entrances

- **Definition**: Each time someone accesses your website
- **Scope**: Website-level metric
- **Purpose**: Measure overall website traffic
- **Calculation**: One entrance per website access
- **Use case**: Understanding total website visits

### Pageviews

- **Definition**: Each time a specific page is loaded
- **Scope**: Page-level metric
- **Purpose**: Measure individual page popularity
- **Calculation**: One pageview per page load
- **Use case**: Understanding content performance

### Relationship Example

```
User Journey:
1. User enters site on homepage → 1 Entrance, 1 Pageview (homepage)
2. User clicks to About page → 0 Entrances, 1 Pageview (about)
3. User clicks to Contact page → 0 Entrances, 1 Pageview (contact)
4. User leaves and returns to homepage → 1 Entrance, 1 Pageview (homepage)

Total: 2 Entrances, 4 Pageviews
```

## Privacy and Compliance Benefits

### GDPR Compliance

- **No personal data**: Entrance counting doesn't require personal information
- **No tracking**: Users aren't tracked across sessions or devices
- **Data minimization**: Collects only necessary metrics
- **Transparent processing**: Clear methodology for data collection

### Technical Advantages

- **Server-side calculation**: Can be calculated server-side without JavaScript
- **Ad-blocker resistant**: Basic counting works even with ad blockers
- **Performance friendly**: Minimal impact on website performance
- **Simple implementation**: Easy to implement and maintain

## Business Intelligence Applications

### Traffic Analysis

- **Volume measurement**: Understand total website traffic volume
- **Peak identification**: Identify traffic peaks and patterns
- **Source analysis**: See which sources drive most entrances
- **Growth tracking**: Monitor entrance growth over time
- **Comparative analysis**: Compare entrance volumes across periods

### Marketing Effectiveness

- **Campaign measurement**: Measure campaign effectiveness by entrances
- **Channel comparison**: Compare marketing channels by entrance volume
- **Content performance**: Understand which content drives entrances
- **Conversion correlation**: Correlate entrances with conversion events
- **ROI calculation**: Calculate return on marketing investment

## Interpreting Entrance Data

### When Entrances are Higher

- **Mobile usage**: Mobile users often have shorter, more frequent visits
- **Social traffic**: Social media drives multiple quick visits
- **Content consumption**: Users return for different content pieces

- **Deep content**: Content that keeps users engaged longer
- **Complex workflows**: Multi-step processes keeping users on site
- **Application usage**: Web applications with sustained usage

## Best Practices for Analysis

### Comparative Analysis

- **Time periods**: Compare entrances across different time periods
