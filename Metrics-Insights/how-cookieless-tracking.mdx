## The Foundation: Referrer-Based Attribution

### What is a Referrer?

The **referrer** is the webpage URL that directed a visitor to your site. When someone clicks a link, their browser automatically sends the previous page's URL as the "referrer" header to your website.

**Example:**

- User searches "analytics software" on Google
- Clicks your website link in search results
- Referrer sent to your site: `https://www.google.com`

### How SealMetrics Uses Referrer Data

SealMetrics analyzes the referrer information to determine the traffic source for each visit (or "hit") and categorizes traffic accordingly. This referrer-based system replaces the need for cookies or other persistent tracking methods.

## Traffic Classification System

### 1. SEO (Organic Search) Traffic

**Identification Criteria:**

- Referrer comes from recognized search engines
- Common search engine domains include:
  - `google.com` (and country variants like `google.co.uk`)
  - `bing.com`
  - `duckduckgo.com`
  - `yahoo.com`
  - `baidu.com`
  - `yandex.com`

**Example Classification:**

```
Referrer: https://www.google.com/search?q=analytics+software
→ Traffic Source: SEO (Google)
```

**Search Engine Recognition:** SealMetrics maintains an updated database of search engine domains to ensure accurate classification of organic search traffic from various global and local search providers.

### 2. Social Media Traffic

**Identification Criteria:**

- Referrer originates from social media platforms
- Recognized social platforms include:
  - `facebook.com` / `fb.com`
  - `x.com` / `twitter.com`
  - `linkedin.com`
  - `instagram.com`
  - `youtube.com`
  - `tiktok.com`
  - `pinterest.com`
  - `reddit.com`

**Example Classification:**

```
Referrer: https://x.com/user/status/123456789
→ Traffic Source: X (Social)
```

**Platform-Specific Handling:** Different social platforms may have unique referrer patterns, which SealMetrics recognizes to provide accurate attribution to specific social media channels.

### 3. Direct Traffic

**Identification Criteria:**

- Referrer field is completely empty
- No previous webpage information available

**Common Direct Traffic Scenarios:**

- **URL Direct Entry:** User types website address directly in browser
- **Bookmarks:** User clicks saved bookmark
- **Email Links:** Many email clients strip referrer information
- **Mobile Apps:** Native app links often lack referrer data
- **Secure Sources:** HTTPS to HTTP transitions block referrer
- **Privacy Tools:** Browser extensions or privacy settings remove referrers

**Example Classification:**

```
Referrer: [empty]
→ Traffic Source: Direct
```

**Important Note:** High direct traffic percentages may indicate referrer loss rather than actual direct visits. See our guide on "Understanding Referrer Loss" for detailed analysis.

### 4. Internal Page Views

**Identification Criteria:**

- Referrer domain matches your website domain
- User navigating between pages on the same site

**Example Classification:**

```
Referrer: https://yourwebsite.com/homepage
Current Page: https://yourwebsite.com/about
→ Classification: Internal Page View (not a new visit)
```

**Internal Navigation Handling:**

- Same-domain navigation doesn't create new "visits"
- Tracks user engagement within your site
- Maintains user journey continuity
- Enables funnel and path analysis

## Advanced Traffic Source Recognition

### UTM Parameter Integration

While referrer data provides the foundation, SealMetrics also recognizes and utilizes UTM parameters for enhanced attribution:

**UTM Parameter Priority:** When UTM parameters are present, they override referrer-based classification:

```
URL: https://yoursite.com?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=summer-sale
→ Traffic Source: Newsletter (Email) - Summer Sale Campaign
```

**UTM Parameters Recognized:**

- `utm_source` - Traffic source identifier
- `utm_medium` - Marketing medium
- `utm_campaign` - Campaign name
- `utm_term` - Keyword (for paid search)
- `utm_content` - Content differentiation

### Paid Advertising Detection

**Google Ads Identification:** SealMetrics automatically detects Google Ads traffic through:

- `gclid` parameter (Google Click Identifier)
- `gad` parameter
- `gbraid` and `wbraid` parameters
- Other Google Ads auto-tagging parameters

**Facebook Ads Detection:**

- `fbclid` parameter (Facebook Click Identifier)
- Custom UTM parameters used by Facebook campaigns

**Other Paid Platform Recognition:**

- Platform-specific click identifiers
- Custom tracking parameters
- UTM-based paid campaign identification

## Privacy Compliance Advantages

### GDPR Compliance

**No Personal Data Collection:**

- No cookies storing user identifiers
- No cross-site tracking capabilities
- No personal data requiring consent
- Immediate data anonymization

**Legal Benefits:**

- No need for cookie consent banners
- Simplified privacy policy requirements
- Reduced data protection obligations
- Lower compliance complexity

### Browser Compatibility

**Immune to Privacy Changes:**

- Unaffected by cookie blocking
- Works with all browser privacy settings
- Functions in incognito/private browsing mode
- Compatible with ad blockers (for non-ad content)

**Cross-Device Limitations:**

- Cannot track users across devices (privacy feature)
- No cross-browser tracking
- Each visit treated independently
- Focus on aggregate behavior patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Processing

**How It Works:**

1. Browser sends HTTP request with referrer header
2. SealMetrics server receives and processes referrer data
3. Traffic source classification occurs server-side
4. Data aggregated without personal identifiers
5. Reports generated from anonymized data

**Processing Pipeline:**

```
User Click → Referrer Header → SealMetrics Server → Classification → Aggregated Reports
```
