# How Cookieless Tracking Works

Discover how Sealmetrics implements cookieless tracking to provide accurate analytics while maintaining full privacy compliance.

## What is Cookieless Tracking?

Cookieless tracking is a method of collecting analytics data without relying on browser cookies or other persistent identifiers that track individual users.

### Traditional vs Cookieless Approach

#### Traditional Cookie-Based Tracking
- Stores unique identifiers in browser cookies
- Tracks individual user journeys across sessions
- Requires user consent under GDPR/CCPA
- Blocked by privacy tools and browser settings
- Creates incomplete data due to consent barriers

#### Sealmetrics Cookieless Approach
- No individual user tracking or identification
- Aggregated data collection at system level
- No consent requirements under privacy laws
- Unaffected by ad blockers or privacy tools
- Captures 100% of traffic without data loss

1. **Captures Events**: Records page views, clicks, and conversions
2. **Aggregates Immediately**: Groups data without storing individual identifiers
3. **Processes in Real-time**: Provides instant analytics without delays
4. **Maintains Privacy**: Never creates individual user profiles

### Technical Implementation
