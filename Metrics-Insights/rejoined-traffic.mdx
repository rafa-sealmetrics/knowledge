title: "What is Rejoined Traffic in SealMetrics"
---

# 

## Definition

**Rejoined Traffic** represents visits from users who have resumed browsing on your website after more than 6 hours of inactivity. Instead of categorizing this returning traffic as "Direct" (as most analytics platforms do), SealMetrics specifically labels it as "Rejoined Traffic" to provide clearer attribution and prevent inflation of direct traffic numbers.

## The Problem with Traditional Analytics

### How Other Platforms Handle Returning Users

Most analytics tools, including Google Analytics 4 (GA4), classify returning users after session timeouts as:

- **Direct Traffic** - Even when users originally came from SEO, social media, or paid campaigns
- **New Sessions** - Creating artificial session breaks that obscure true user behavior
- **Lost Attribution** - Original traffic source becomes invisible after timeout periods

### The "Direct Traffic Chaos" Problem

This traditional approach creates several analytical problems:

1. **Inflated Direct Traffic Numbers**
   - Users who originally came from Google searches get reclassified as "Direct"
   - Paid campaign visitors appear as "Direct" after breaks
   - Social media traffic gets lost in the "Direct" category
2. **Attribution Confusion**
   - Marketers can't distinguish true direct traffic from returning visitors
   - Campaign ROI calculations become inaccurate
   - Channel performance assessment gets distorted
3. **Decision-Making Challenges**
   - Budget allocation based on false direct traffic assumptions
   - Missed optimization opportunities for actual traffic sources
   - Incomplete understanding of customer journey patterns

## SealMetrics' Solution: Rejoined Traffic Classification

### How Rejoined Traffic Works

When a user returns to your website after more than 6 hours of inactivity, SealMetrics:

1. **Recognizes the Pattern** - Identifies that this is a returning visitor rather than a new session
2. **Preserves Context** - Acknowledges this represents resumed engagement
3. **Clear Labeling** - Explicitly categorizes it as "Rejoined Traffic"
4. **Prevents Misattribution** - Avoids inflating Direct traffic statistics

### The 6-Hour Threshold

**Why 6 Hours?**

- Balances session continuity with practical user behavior
- Accounts for work breaks, sleep, and daily routine interruptions
- Distinguishes between short breaks and genuine re-engagement periods
- Prevents over-segmentation while maintaining analytical clarity

**Examples of 6\+ Hour Gaps:**

- Morning research, return in evening for purchase
- Workday interruptions and after-hours browsing
- Weekend discovery, weekday follow-up
- Multi-day consideration periods for major purchases

## Traffic Source Preservation Insights

### What Rejoined Traffic Reveals

Rejoined Traffic actually represents **reactivated visitors from any original source**:

- **SEO Rejoined** - Users who originally found you through search engines
- **Social Rejoined** - Visitors who first came from social media platforms
- **Paid Rejoined** - Users from advertising campaigns returning later
- **Referral Rejoined** - Visitors originally from other websites
- **Direct Rejoined** - Users who genuinely typed your URL initially

### Strategic Value

Understanding Rejoined Traffic helps with:

1. **User Engagement Analysis**
   - Identifies high-interest visitors who return multiple times
   - Reveals content or products that drive return visits
   - Shows delayed conversion patterns
2. **Marketing Attribution**
   - Cleaner separation between true direct traffic and returning visitors
   - More accurate assessment of original traffic source performance
   - Better understanding of customer consideration periods
3. **Conversion Optimization**
   - Recognizes users in extended decision-making processes
   - Identifies opportunities for retargeting or nurturing campaigns
   - Reveals multi-session conversion paths
