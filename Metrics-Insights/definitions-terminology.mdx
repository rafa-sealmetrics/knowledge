## Core Metrics

### Visit

A **visit** occurs when a user lands on your website from an external source. Specifically, a visit is counted when:

- The referrer is empty (direct traffic)
- The referrer originates from a different domain

**Important Notes:**

- Each entry to your site counts as a separate visit
- Refreshing or reloading the landing page multiple times still counts as separate visits
- Internal navigation (same domain) does not generate new visits

**Examples:**

- User types your URL directly → **Visit**
- User clicks from Google search results → **Visit**
- User navigates from page A to page B on your site → **Page View** (not a visit)

### Page View

A **page view** is recorded when a visitor loads or reloads any page on your website where the referrer is the same domain (internal navigation).

**Characteristics:**

- Tracks content consumption within your site
- Measures user engagement beyond initial landing
- Helps understand user journey through your website
- Does not count as new visits

**Examples:**

- User moves from homepage to about page → **Page View**
- User refreshes the current page → **Page View**
- User uses browser back button within your site → **Page View**

### Event

An **event** represents any specific interaction or action on your website that you choose to track beyond standard page views.

**Common Event Types:**

- Button clicks
- Form submissions
- Video plays/pauses
- File downloads
- Scroll depth milestones
- Time-based engagement
- Custom business actions

**Event Structure:**

- **Event Type:** The category of action (e.g., 'click', 'download', 'video')
- **Event Label:** Specific identifier (e.g., 'contact-form', 'pricing-pdf')
- **Event Value:** Optional numeric value for business impact

## Business Metrics

### Conversion

A **conversion** is a user action that aligns with your predefined business goals and represents successful completion of desired outcomes.

**Types of Conversions:**

- **Primary Conversions:** Main business objectives (purchases, signups, leads)
- **Secondary Conversions:** Supporting goals (newsletter subscriptions, resource downloads)

**Conversion Characteristics:**

- Must be explicitly tracked with conversion pixels or events
- Can have monetary values assigned
- Used for ROI calculations and campaign optimization
- Tracked regardless of user consent (privacy-compliant)

### Microconversion

A **microconversion** is an intermediate action that indicates user progress toward a primary conversion goal but represents a smaller commitment level.

**Examples of Microconversions:**

- Newsletter subscription
- Adding items to shopping cart
- Creating user account
- Downloading whitepapers
- Engaging with pricing calculator
- Spending significant time on key pages

**Strategic Value:**

- Indicates user intent and engagement level
- Helps optimize conversion funnels
- Provides early indicators of campaign success
- Enables nurturing strategies for partial conversions

### Funnel

A **funnel** represents the defined sequence of steps that users must complete to reach a specific business goal.

**Funnel Components:**

- **Entry Point:** How users enter the funnel
- **Intermediate Steps:** Required actions or page visits
- **Conversion Point:** Final goal completion
- **Drop-off Points:** Where users exit without converting

**Funnel Analysis Benefits:**

- Identifies optimization opportunities

**Common Subdomain Examples:**

- `blog.example.com` - Company blog
- `shop.example.com` - E-commerce section
