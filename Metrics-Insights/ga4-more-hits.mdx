# Why Sealmetrics Captures More Data Than GA4

Discover the fundamental differences between Sealmetrics and Google Analytics 4, and why you're seeing 40-60% more data with our privacy-first approach.

## The Data Gap Problem

### What You're Missing with GA4

Google Analytics 4 typically captures only **40-60% of your actual traffic** due to:

- **Consent Requirements**: Users who decline cookies aren't tracked
- **Ad Blockers**: Privacy tools block GA4 tracking
- **Browser Restrictions**: Safari and Firefox limit tracking capabilities
- **Data Sampling**: GA4 uses sampling for large datasets
- **Processing Delays**: Data can take 24-48 hours to appear

### What Sealmetrics Captures

Sealmetrics captures **100% of your traffic** because:

- **No Consent Needed**: Cookieless tracking doesn't require user permission
- **Ad Blocker Proof**: Our method isn't blocked by privacy tools
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works across all browsers and devices
- **No Sampling**: Every visitor and interaction is counted
- **Real-Time Data**: Instant data availability

Sealmetrics provides the complete picture. Use these numbers for business decisions and planning.

#### "How do I explain this to stakeholders?"
Emphasize that you now have access to 100% of your data, not just the portion from users who accepted cookies.

4. **Update Reporting**: Use complete data for decisions

### Best Practices
- **Baseline Reset**: Establish new performance baselines
- **Historical Context**: Understand that past GA4 data was incomplete
- **Team Education**: Train team on new data reality
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Explain the data completeness advantage

The difference isn't just about numbers—it's about making decisions based on complete, accurate data rather than a partial view of your audience.
