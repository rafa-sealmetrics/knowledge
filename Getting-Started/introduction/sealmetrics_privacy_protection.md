# How Sealmetrics Protects User Privacy

## Privacy Philosophy: Beyond Compliance

At Sealmetrics, privacy isn't just about meeting regulatory requirements—it's a fundamental philosophy that guides every aspect of our platform. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right, and our approach goes beyond what's legally required to ensure genuine protection for all users.

## Core Privacy Principles

### 1. Privacy Over Profit
Sealmetrics prioritizes user privacy even when regulations might allow certain data collection practices. If tracking a particular KPI would violate user privacy, we simply don't track it—even if legally permitted.

### 2. No Individual Tracking
Our platform is designed so that it's impossible to connect any data to specific individuals. Unlike traditional analytics that build user profiles, Sealmetrics focuses on aggregate behavior patterns without personal identification.

### 3. Data Minimization
We collect only the data necessary for meaningful analytics insights, adhering to the principle of data minimization that's central to modern privacy frameworks.

## Technical Privacy Protections

### No Cookies Technology
- **Zero cookie dependence**: No first-party or third-party cookies used for tracking
- **No local storage**: Avoids browser storage mechanisms that could identify users
- **Session-only identifiers**: Temporary session IDs that don't persist across visits

### No Personal Data Collection
**What We Don't Collect:**
- IP addresses (not stored or processed)
- User agent strings for identification
- Device fingerprints
- Personal identifiers of any kind
- Cross-site tracking data
- Behavioral profiles linked to individuals

**What We Do Collect:**
- Aggregated page view data
- Anonymous session behavior
- General geographic regions (not precise locations)
- Referral sources (without personal data)
- Conversion events (anonymized)

### Advanced Anonymization
- **Immediate anonymization**: All data is anonymized at the point of collection
- **No retroactive identification**: Impossible to de-anonymize collected data
- **Contextual data only**: Information about interactions, not about individuals

## Dual Tracking System Privacy

### Session-ID Based Tracking
- **Temporary identifiers**: Session IDs exist only for the duration of a visit
- **No cross-session linking**: Each visit is treated independently
- **Automatic expiration**: Session data automatically expires

### Isolated Hits Based Tracking
- **Individual interaction capture**: Each action recorded separately
- **No user journey reconstruction**: Cannot build complete user profiles
- **Privacy-preserving aggregation**: Data combined only in anonymous statistical form
