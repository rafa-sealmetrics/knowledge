## What is a Sales Funnel?

With SealMetrics, users can create a funnel based on micro conversions and events, such as analyzing a sales funnel. For example, a user might:

1. **Add an item to cart** (micro conversion)
2. **Initiate checkout** (micro conversion)
3. **Complete a sale** (final conversion)

The funnel can be easily adjusted, and changes automatically update both the graph and data table.

Step 4: Purchase â†’ 6% (600 users)
```

**Analysis**:

- Cart conversion rate: 15% (good)
- Checkout drop-off: 47% (needs optimization)
- Purchase completion: 75% (excellent)
