# Definitions

### 📊 Entrances

**Definition**: An Entrance is a click with an empty referrer or a referrer with a domain different from your domain.

**How it works**:

- **Direct traffic**: When someone types your URL directly or uses a bookmark
- **External referrals**: When someone clicks a link from another website
- **Search engines**: When someone finds your site through search results
- **Social media**: When someone clicks a link from social platforms

**Example**: If a user comes to your site from Google search, that counts as one entrance.

### 👀 Pageview

**Definition**: How many times a page has been viewed.

**Key points**:

- Each page load counts as one pageview
- Multiple views by the same user count separately
- Refreshing a page creates a new pageview
- Useful for understanding content popularity

**Example**: If 100 people visit your homepage and 50 of them refresh it once, you'll have 150 pageviews.

### 🎯 Conversions

**Definition**: Each time an action marked and assigned by the user has been accomplished. We suggest marking just the purchases as conversion.

**Best practices**:

- **Primary conversions**: Purchases, sign-ups, leads
- **Focus on value**: Track actions that directly impact business goals
- **Avoid over-tracking**: Don't mark every small action as a conversion
- **Business impact**: Choose conversions that matter to your bottom line

**Example**: An e-commerce site should track purchases as conversions, not just product page views.

### 💰 Revenue

**Definition**: The pixel of conversion saves the value of every purchase so you can find the total amount of the purchases in the revenue section.

**Revenue tracking**:

- **Purchase values**: Exact amount of each transaction
- **Currency support**: Multi-currency tracking available
- **Attribution**: Revenue attributed to correct traffic sources
- **Tax handling**: Include or exclude taxes as needed

**Example**: If someone buys a \$50 product and a \$30 product, the revenue is \$80.

### 🔄 Micro Conversion

**Definition**: Each time an action marked and assigned by the user has been accomplished. Ex. Add an item to the cart.

**Common micro conversions**:

- **Add to cart**: Product interest indicator
- **Newsletter signup**: Lead generation
- **Video views**: Content engagement
- **Form starts**: Intent indicators
- **Download requests**: Content value
- **Account creation**: User commitment

**Example**: When someone adds a product to cart but doesn't purchase, that's a micro conversion.

### 💸 Cost

**Definition**: The total amount of your marketing investment.

**Cost components**:

- **Advertising spend**: Paid media costs
- **Agency fees**: Management and service costs
- **Platform fees**: Technology and software costs
- **Creative production**: Design and content creation costs

**Example**: If you spend \$1,000 on Google Ads and \$500 on Facebook Ads, your total cost is \$1,500.

### 📈 Conversion Rate

**Definition**: The number of users who converted as a percentage of the total number of users that visited your site.

**Calculation**:

```
Conversion Rate = (Conversions ÷ Entrances) × 100
```

**Example calculation**:

- 1,000 entrances
- 50 conversions
- Conversion rate = (50 ÷ 1,000) × 100 = 5%

### 🏷️ Conversion Type

**Definition**: The amount for conversion for each type of conversion assigned by you.

**Types of conversions**:

- **Purchase**: E-commerce transactions
- **Lead**: Contact form submissions
- **Signup**: Account registrations
- **Download**: Resource downloads
- **Subscription**: Newsletter or service subscriptions

**Value assignment**: Each type can have different values based on business impact.

### 🥇 Top Medium

**Definition**: The mediums that guarantee the most affluence (using a UTM that needs to be reassigned) for entrances and conversions.

**Common mediums**:

- **Organic**: SEO traffic from search engines
- **CPC**: Paid search advertising
- **Social**: Social media traffic
- **Email**: Email marketing campaigns
- **Referral**: Traffic from other websites
- **Direct**: Direct website visits

### 🌟 Top Sources

**Definition**: The main sources from which your traffic comes.

**Traffic sources examples**:

- **Google**: Search engine traffic
- **Facebook**: Social media traffic
- **LinkedIn**: Professional network traffic
- **Newsletter**: Email campaign traffic
- **Partner sites**: Referral traffic

## Advanced Metrics

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

**Calculation**:

```
ROAS = Revenue ÷ Cost
```

**Interpretation**:

- **ROAS \> 3:1**: Generally profitable
- **ROAS 2:1-3:1**: Moderate performance
- **ROAS \< 2:1**: Needs optimization

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

While not directly shown in basic reports, this can be calculated using:

- Average order value
- Purchase frequency
- Customer retention rate

### Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

**Calculation**:

```
CPA = Cost ÷ Conversions
```

**Example**: \$1,000 cost with 50 conversions = \$20 CPA

## Metric Relationships

### Funnel Metrics

Understanding how metrics relate in a typical conversion funnel:

```
Entrances → Pageviews → Micro Conversions → Conversions → Revenue
```

## Common Calculations

### Performance Comparisons

- **Period-over-period**: Compare current vs. previous period
- **Channel comparison**: Compare performance across sources
- **Campaign analysis**: Compare different marketing campaigns
