1. Select Conversion.
2. Enter a name for this conversion.
3. Would you like to add a value to this conversion?
4. If you click "Yes," you must add the Revenue Variable or a fixed value in this field.
5. Save. You can copy and paste the code in your GTM, but by saving it, you can retrieve this pixel in the future and gain valuable information, such as when the pixel was last triggered.
6. Ignore page view?

### **When do you choose Ignore page view?**

When you'd like to track events that doesn't launch a page view. For example:

- Scroll downs.
- Click on buttons.
- Track when I cookie consent banner is shown

**When you should use 'Ignore page view' = No?**

When you'd like to track events that launch a page view. For example:

1. Add to carts
2. Begin Checkout
3. Thank you pages

This code must be triggered when the conversion is done.

Here you'll find how to do that with Google Tag Manager:

As you can see in the image, the pixel is triggered in "All Pages" (#1) except when a conversion is "Done" (#2)
