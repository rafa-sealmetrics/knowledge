# Cost Calculator

SealMetrics has introduced an advanced cost calculator to help you calculate the Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) per channel. This powerful tool allows you to filter and analyze your traffic sources with precise cost attribution and automated ROAS calculations.

## How the Cost Calculator Works

At SealMetrics, we have introduced a cost calculator in order to be able to calculate the ROAS per channel. With this tool, you can filter, for example, your traffic sources. In this case, Google - we click on the euro symbol at cost, and at this point, we are going to apply a cost to Google.

## Flexible Cost Configuration

### Time-Based Cost Management

The system allows you to set different costs for different time periods. For example:

**Scenario 1: January Campaign**

- **Period**: January 1-31
- **CPC**: €1.00
- **System calculation**: Automatically calculates total cost based on clicks received during January

**Scenario 2: February Strategy Change**

- **Period**: February 1-28
- **CPC**: €2.00
- **Automatic application**: System applies €1.00 CPC for January traffic and €2.00 CPC for February traffic

### Dynamic Cost Calculation

When you click "create," the system will automatically apply the correct CPC (€1.00 or €2.00) depending on the time period being analyzed. This allows for:

- **Campaign evolution tracking**: Monitor how cost changes affect performance
- **Budget period analysis**: Analyze different budget allocations
- **Strategy comparison**: Compare performance across different cost structures

## Three Cost Calculation Methods

The cost calculator supports three different types of cost attribution:

### 1. CPC (Cost Per Click)

**Use case**: Pay-per-click advertising campaigns

- **How it works**: Set your average cost per click
- **Calculation**: Total cost = CPC × Number of clicks
- **Best for**: Google Ads, Facebook Ads, PPC campaigns
- **Example**: €1.50 CPC × 10,000 clicks = €15,000 total cost

### 2. CPA (Cost Per Action/Conversion)

**Use case**: Performance-based advertising

- **How it works**: Set cost for each conversion achieved
- **Calculation**: Total cost = CPA × Number of conversions
- **Best for**: Lead generation, affiliate marketing, conversion-focused campaigns
- **Example**: €10.00 CPA × 1,500 conversions = €15,000 total cost

### 3. Sponsorship (Daily Cost)

**Use case**: Fixed budget campaigns and brand partnerships

- **How it works**: Set a daily advertising spend
- **Calculation**: Total cost = Daily cost × Number of days
- **Best for**: SEO agency costs, fixed monthly budgets, brand sponsorships
- **Example**: SEO agency costing €3,000 per month = €100 daily cost

## Advanced Use Cases

<Tip>
  Start with one cost method per channel to establish baseline ROAS, then experiment with more granular cost tracking as you become comfortable with the system
</Tip>

<Note>
  Ensure all marketing costs are included in your calculations.  Hidden costs like platform fees, agency management fees, and tool subscriptions can significantly impact true ROAS calculations.
