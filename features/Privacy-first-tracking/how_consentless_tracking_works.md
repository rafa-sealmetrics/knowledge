# How Consentless Tracking Works

## Understanding the Technical Foundation

Consentless tracking represents a fundamental shift from traditional analytics that rely on individual user identification to aggregate data collection that respects privacy while providing comprehensive insights. Sealmetrics pioneered this approach through innovative measurement technologies that capture complete website behavior without compromising user privacy.

## The Core Methodology

### Aggregate Data Collection vs. Individual Tracking

**Traditional Analytics Approach:**

- Deposits cookies containing visitor IDs
- Tracks individual user journeys across sessions
- Creates detailed user profiles and behavior patterns
- Requires consent under GDPR and ePrivacy regulations
- Loses 50-85% of data when users decline tracking

**Sealmetrics Consentless Approach:**

- Measures website interactions as aggregate events
- No individual user identification or profiling
- Treats all interactions as part of one large collective dataset
- No consent required due to privacy-preserving methodology
- Captures 100% of website traffic data

### The Dual Tracking System Architecture

Sealmetrics implements the world's only dual consentless analytics system, combining two distinct measurement technologies:

## Session-ID Based Tracking

### How It Works

- **Temporary Session Identification**: Assigns a unique ID to each individual session
- **No Cross-Session Linking**: Each session is treated as an independent entity
- **Automatic Expiration**: Session IDs expire when the visit ends

### Data Captured

- Page views within the session
- Events that occur in the session

### Privacy Safeguards

- **No Persistent Identification**: Session IDs don't persist across browser sessions
- **No User Profiling**: Impossible to build long-term user profiles
- **Immediate Anonymization**: All data anonymized at the point of collection
- **No Personal Data**: No connection to individual identity possible

## Isolated Hits Based Tracking

### How It Works

- **Individual Hit Capture**: SEAL tracks "hits" or page views as completely isolated events
- **No Correlation Between Hits**: Each click is not correlated with other clicks from the same user
- **No User Behavior Tracking**: We don't track users' behavior patterns across sessions
- **Maximum Privacy**: Highest level of anonymization through complete isolation

### The Four-Variable System

From each hit, SEAL tracks only these four essential variables:

1. **Timestamp**: When the page view occurred
2. **User Agent**: Browser information (not stored for privacy)
3. **Current URL**: The page being viewed
4. **Referral URL**: Where the visitor came from

### Data Processing

- **Hit-Level Analysis**: Each page view recorded independently without correlation
- **Statistical Aggregation**: Individual isolated hits combined into meaningful business metrics
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate compilation of aggregate statistics from isolated hits

### Use Cases

- **Healthcare Organizations**: Maximum privacy for sensitive sectors
- **Government Entities**: Compliance with strictest privacy requirements
- **High-Security Environments**: Where anonymity is paramount
- **Maximum Speed Processing**: Fastest possible data processing

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection Process

**Step 1: Event Detection**

- JavaScript tracker detects website interactions
- Events captured without personal identifiers
- No cookies, local storage, or fingerprinting used
- Immediate anonymization at source

**Step 2: Data Processing**

- Events processed using privacy-preserving algorithms
- Aggregate patterns identified from collective data
- Statistical analysis performed on anonymous datasets
- Real-time compilation of meaningful metrics

**Step 3: Insight Generation**

- Business intelligence extracted from aggregate patterns
- Performance metrics derived without individual tracking
- Actionable insights provided while maintaining privacy

### The "Ping" Methodology

Similar to search engines' web crawling, Sealmetrics uses "pings" to collect data:

**Traditional Analytics Pings:**

- Can be associated with individual users
- Require consent for personal data processing
- Build individual user profiles over time

**Sealmetrics Privacy Pings:**

- Cannot be associated with any individual
- No consent required due to anonymous nature
- Contribute to aggregate understanding only

## Tracker Options for Different Privacy Needs

## Privacy-Preserving Attribution

### Campaign Attribution Without Individual Tracking

**Challenge:** How to attribute conversions to marketing campaigns without tracking individuals?

**Sealmetrics Solution:**

- **Aggregate Attribution Models**: Last-click model
- **UTM Parameter Processing**: Campaign data processed anonymously
- **Conversion Attribution**: Last-click model

## Compliance Through Design

### GDPR Compliance Without Consent

**How It Works:**

- **No Personal Data Processing**: Platform doesn't process any personal data
- **Aggregate Data Only**: All insights derived from collective anonymous data
- **No Individual Rights Issues**: No personal data means no individual rights concerns
- **Automatic Compliance**: Compliance built into the technical architecture

### ePrivacy Regulation Compliance

**Technical Compliance:**

- **No Individual User Tracking**: SEAL's isolated hits system doesn't track individual users
- **No Terminal Equipment Code**: Doesn't insert any code in the user's terminal
- **Isolated Page Views**: Each hit is completely disconnected from others
- **European Infrastructure**: SEAL is a European company with servers in Dublin
- **Consent-Free Operation**: Technical design based on isolated hits eliminates consent requirements

**ePrivacy Interpretation:**
According to our interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive, tracking individual users requires consent, even for anonymous analytics. SEAL's solution eliminates this requirement by tracking only isolated hits that cannot be correlated to individual user behavior.

## Real-World Implementation

### Website Integration

**Simple Implementation:**

```html
<!-- Basic Sealmetrics Implementation -->
<script>
/* SealMetrics Tracker Code */
(function() {
var options = {
   account: 'ADD-ACCOUNT-ID',
   event: 'pageview',
   use_session: 1,
};
var url="//app.sealmetrics.com/tag/v2/tracker";function loadScript(callback){var script=document.createElement("script");script.src=url;script.async=true;script.onload=function(){if(typeof callback==="function"){callback();}};script.onerror=function(){console.error("Error loading script: "+url);};document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);}loadScript(function(){options.id=Math.floor((Math.random()*999)+1);if(window.sm){var instance=new window.sm(options);instance.track(options.event);}else{console.error("sm2 plugin is not available");}});
})();
/* End SealMetrics Tracker Code */
</script>
```

## The Technical Advantage

Sealmetrics' consentless tracking works because it fundamentally reimagines web analytics. Instead of trying to make individual tracking more private, it eliminates individual tracking entirely while still providing all the business intelligence needed for effective decision-making.

This approach represents the future of web analyticsâ€”where privacy protection and business intelligence aren't competing objectives, but complementary aspects of a superior analytics solution that serves both users and businesses better than traditional tracking methods.
