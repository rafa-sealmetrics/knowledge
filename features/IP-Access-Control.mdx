# Enhance Your SealMetrics with IP Access Control

Welcome to an even more secure SealMetrics experience\! We're excited to introduce IP-based access control, giving you complete control over who can access your analytics dashboard from approved locations.

## ðŸ”’ Your Security Matters

Now you can add an extra layer of protection to your SealMetrics dashboard by restricting access to specific IP addresses. This **enterprise-grade security feature** ensures that only authorized users from approved locations can view your valuable analytics data.

## Setting Up IP Access Control

Follow these simple steps to configure IP access control:

### Step 1: Navigate to Security Settings

Access the **Security Settings** in your SealMetrics dashboard through your account settings or admin panel.

### Step 2: Add Approved IP Addresses or Ranges

Configure the IP addresses or IP ranges that should have access to your dashboard:

- **Single IP addresses**: `192.168.1.100`
- **IP ranges using CIDR notation**: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Multiple entries**: Add as many IPs or ranges as needed

### Step 3: Save Your Configuration

Once you've added all approved IP addresses, save your configuration to activate the access control.

## How IP Access Control Works

### Seamless Access for Authorized Users

Your team can continue accessing the dashboard seamlessly from the authorized IPs, while **unauthorized access attempts will be automatically blocked**.

### Real-time Protection

- **Immediate enforcement**: Changes take effect immediately
- **Automatic blocking**: Unauthorized IPs are blocked automatically
- **No impact on performance**: Dashboard speed remains unaffected
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Protects all dashboard areas

## Understanding CIDR Notation

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a standardized method for describing IP address ranges efficiently. Understanding CIDR helps you configure network access precisely.

### CIDR Format

CIDR notation uses the format: `IP_ADDRESS/PREFIX_LENGTH`

### Common CIDR Examples

#### Single Host Configuration

```
192.168.1.100/32  â†’ Only 192.168.1.100
10.0.0.50/32      â†’ Only 10.0.0.50
```

#### Small Private Network Range

```
192.168.1.0/24    â†’ 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 (254 hosts)
10.0.1.0/24       â†’ 10.0.1.1 to 10.0.1.254 (254 hosts)
```

#### Complete Private Network Range

```
192.168.0.0/16    â†’ 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.255.254 (65,534 hosts)
10.0.0.0/16       â†’ 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.254 (65,534 hosts)
```

#### Large Corporate Network Range

```
10.0.0.0/8        â†’ 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254 (16,777,214 hosts)
172.16.0.0/12     â†’ 172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254 (1,048,574 hosts)
```

#### Public IP Range Example

```
203.0.113.0/24    â†’ 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.254 (254 hosts)
198.51.100.0/28   â†’ 198.51.100.1 to 198.51.100.14 (14 hosts)
```

## Common Private Network Ranges

### Home and Small Office Networks

- **192.168.1.0/24**: Most common home router default
- **192.168.0.0/24**: Alternative home network range
- **10.0.0.0/24**: Apple and some routers default

### Corporate Networks

## Best Practices

### Security Recommendations

- **Principle of least privilege**: Only allow necessary IP ranges
- **Regular audits**: Review and update IP lists quarterly
- **Document changes**: Maintain records of who has access
- **Monitor access**: Review access logs regularly

### Network Configuration

- **Use specific ranges**: Avoid overly broad CIDR blocks
- **Test before implementing**: Verify access from all required locations
- **Plan for remote work**: Include home office and mobile worker IPs
- **Consider VPN**: Use VPN for simplified management

### Operational Considerations

- **Backup access**: Ensure multiple authorized locations
- **Emergency access**: Plan for urgent access scenarios
- **Change management**: Coordinate IP changes with IT team
- **User communication**: Inform team about access restrictions

## Troubleshooting Access Issues

### Common Problems

- **Blocked access**: User IP not in approved list
- **Partial access**: CIDR range too restrictive
- **Mobile issues**: Dynamic IP addresses changing
- **VPN conflicts**: VPN IP not whitelisted

### Quick Solutions

1. **Check current IP**: Help users identify their current IP address
2. **Verify CIDR**: Ensure IP ranges include user locations
3. **Test configuration**: Verify settings after changes
4. **Temporary access**: Provide temporary IP allowance for urgent needs

### Getting Help

- **Contact support**: SealMetrics team can assist with configuration
- **Network admin**: Consult your IT team for network specifics
- **Documentation**: Refer to network documentation for IP ranges
- **Testing tools**: Use IP lookup services to verify configurations

<Tip>
  Start with broader IP ranges during initial setup, then gradually narrow them down as you identify specific access patterns. This approach minimizes disruption while establishing security.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Always thoroughly test IP access control configurations before full deployment. Ensure you have alternative access methods available in case of misconfiguration that could lock out administrators.
