## What is 1st Party Tracking?

The 1st-party tracker uses a pixel-based approach, similar to previous tracking methods. However, instead of operating from the standard SealMetrics URL (e.g., `app.sealmetrics.com`), the tracker functions from a subdomain linked to your website, such as `random-numbers.yourdomain.com`.

## Key Benefits

### üö´ Ad Blocker Bypass

Using a 1st-party subdomain, SealMetrics can bypass ad blockers, allowing you to:

- **Collect accurate data** without interruption
- **Maintain complete analytics** even for privacy-conscious users
- **Ensure data continuity** across all user segments
- **Improve measurement accuracy** by capturing previously blocked traffic

### üîí Privacy-First Design

- **Cookie-free tracking**: No data stored on user devices
- **GDPR compliant**: Respects user privacy regulations
- **No personal data storage**: Focuses on aggregate analytics
- **Consent-friendly**: Reduces need for cookie consent banners

### üìä Robust Analytics

This approach provides a **robust, resilient measurement solution** for:

- **Privacy-conscious audiences**: Users who actively block tracking
- **Ad-blocking users**: Maintain analytics for users with ad blockers
- **Enterprise environments**: Corporate networks with strict filtering
- **Mobile users**: Improved tracking on mobile devices with native ad blocking

## How 1st Party Tracking Works

### Traditional 3rd Party Tracking

```
User Browser ‚Üí External Tracker (app.sealmetrics.com) ‚Üí Analytics
‚ùå Often blocked by ad blockers
‚ùå Flagged as 3rd party tracking
‚ùå Requires cookies for user identification
```

### 1st Party Tracking

```
User Browser ‚Üí Your Subdomain (analytics.yourdomain.com) ‚Üí SealMetrics
‚úÖ Appears as same-domain request
‚úÖ Bypasses most ad blockers
‚úÖ No cookies required
```

## Technical Implementation

### Subdomain Setup

Your 1st party tracker operates through a subdomain such as:

- `analytics.yourdomain.com`
- `metrics.yourdomain.com`
- `tracking.yourdomain.com`
- `stats.yourdomain.com`

### DNS Configuration

The subdomain is configured to:

1. **Point to SealMetrics infrastructure**
2. **Maintain your domain authority**
3. **Appear as first-party requests**
4. **Bypass third-party blocking rules**

### Pixel Implementation

The tracking pixel loads from your subdomain:

```
<img src="https://analytics.yourdomain.com/pixel.gif?page=homepage&event=pageview" 
     width="1" height="1" style="display:none" />
```
