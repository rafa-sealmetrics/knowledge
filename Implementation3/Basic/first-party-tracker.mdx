# **How 1st Party Tracking Works**

## **Why Install a First-Party Tracker Instead of a Third-Party Tracker?**

By using our first-party tracker, you'll be better protected against ad blockers. Adblockers often block scripts from third-party companies. However, when you upgrade to a first-party tracker, ad blockers will recognize that the JavaScript is loaded from your own domain and, as a general rule, it will not be blocked.\
​

Log in to [<u>app.sealmetrics.com</u>](http://app.sealmetrics.com) and go to Settings \> First Party Tracker as below:

## **How to Install SealMetrics' First-Party Tracker**

Before installing SealMetrics' first-party tracker, there are a few steps you'll need to complete:

1. The setup screen will display the subdomain you need to create. If you plan to track more than one domain, you'll need to create the same subdomain for each domain.​
2. Add an A record in your DNS Manager with the following value: `45.148.1.221`.
3. Notify us at [<u>hello@sealmetrics.com</u>](mailto:hello@sealmetrics.com) once you have completed the two tasks above.
4. When you receive the green light from [<u>hello@sealmetrics.com</u>](mailto:hello@sealmetrics.com), copy and paste the Tracker Code snippet into the `<head>` tag of your website.

And then the magic starts\!\
