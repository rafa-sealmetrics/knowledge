title: "Cookieless Tracking"

SealMetrics is a cookieless tracking system.\
​Our tracking system is based on aggregated data, meaning SEAL only tracks "hits."\
​According to the ePrivacy Regulation, if you wish to track users individually, even anonymously, you must obtain user consent.\
​SEAL tracks "hits" or page views; each click is not correlated with others, so we do not track users' behavior. Instead, SEAL tracks individual and isolated hits.\
​For each hit, SEAL tracks:

- Timestamp
- User Agent (we do not store the user agent)
- Current URL
- Referral URL

SealMetrics is a cookieless and privacy-first web analytics solution based on just four variables, ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, PECR, and ePrivacy directives. It’s an invaluable tool for both marketers and data analysts.
