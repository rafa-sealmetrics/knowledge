# How SealMetrics consolidates data

SealMetrics employs sophisticated data consolidation processes to transform raw tracking data into meaningful analytics insights while maintaining accuracy and performance.

## Data Collection Pipeline

### Raw Data Ingestion

- **Real-time collection**: Immediate capture of HITS.
- **Multiple sources**: Website tracking, API calls, server-side events
- **Data validation**: Verify data integrity and format compliance
- **Bot filtering**: Remove automated traffic before processing
- **Privacy filtering**: Apply privacy rules and consent management

### Initial Processing

- **Data normalization**: Standardize formats across different sources
- **Event categorization**: Classify events by type (pageview, conversion, etc.)
- **Session assembly**: Group events into user sessions
- **Attribution mapping**: Link events to traffic sources and campaigns
- **Timestamp alignment**: Ensure accurate temporal ordering

## Aggregation Mechanisms

### Time-based Aggregation

- **Hourly summaries**: Initial aggregation at hourly intervals
- **Daily rollups**: Consolidate hourly data into daily metrics
- **Weekly/Monthly views**: Further aggregation for longer-term analysis
- **Real-time updates**: Live metrics updated continuously
- **Historical processing**: Batch processing for historical data

### Dimensional Grouping

- **Traffic sources**: Group by source, medium, campaign
- **Geographic data**: Aggregate by country.
- **Device categories**: Consolidate by device type and browser
- **Content grouping**: Organize by page categories and types

### Metric Calculations

- **Entrances counting**:
- **Conversion tracking**: Goal completion and revenue attribution
- **Performance indicators**: Conversion rates, ROI calculations
- **Comparative analysis**: Period-over-period comparisons

## Data Storage Architecture

### Data Partitioning

- **Time partitioning**: Data organized by time periods
- **Account separation**: Isolated data per analytics account
- **Geographic distribution**: Data stored in appropriate regions
- **Performance optimization**: Partitioning for query efficiency
- **Compliance alignment**: Data residency requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Data Integrity Checks

- **Duplicate detection**: Identify and handle duplicate events
- **Consistency validation**: Ensure data consistency across systems
- **Completeness verification**: Check for missing data points
- **Accuracy testing**: Validate calculations and aggregations
- **Anomaly detection**: Identify unusual patterns or outliers

### Error Handling

- **Data recovery**: Mechanisms to recover from processing errors
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retry for failed processing
- **Error logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and monitoring
- **Alert systems**: Notifications for critical data issues
- **Manual intervention**: Processes for handling edge cases

## Real-time vs Batch Processing

### Real-time Processing

- **Stream processing**: Continuous data processing as events arrive
- **Live dashboards**: Immediate updates to real-time reports
- **Alert triggers**: Real-time notifications for significant events
- **API responses**: Live data for API calls and integrations
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time system health tracking

### Batch Processing

- **Scheduled jobs**: Regular batch processing for complex calculations
- **Historical updates**: Retroactive data processing and corrections
- **Report generation**: Scheduled report creation and distribution
- **Data exports**: Bulk data extraction for external systems
- **Maintenance tasks**: System maintenance and optimization

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

- **Index strategies**: Optimized database indexing for fast queries
- **Query caching**: Cache frequently requested data
- **Pre-aggregation**: Pre-calculate common metrics

- **Audit trails**: Complete tracking of data processing steps

### Better Insights

- **Unified view**: Consolidated data provides comprehensive insights
- **Cross-channel analysis**: Analyze data across multiple channels
- **Historical trends**: Long-term trend analysis capabilities
- **Comparative metrics**: Easy comparison across time periods
- **Actionable intelligence**: Transform data into actionable insights

## API and Export Considerations

### Data Freshness

- **Real-time API**: Access to live data through API calls
- **Batch exports**: Scheduled exports of consolidated data
- **On-demand reports**: Generate reports with latest consolidated data
- **Update frequencies**: Different update schedules for different data types
- **Latency management**: Balance between freshness and performance

### Data Consistency

- **API consistency**: Ensure API responses match dashboard data
- **Export accuracy**: Maintain accuracy in exported data
