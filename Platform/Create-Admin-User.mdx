# How do I create an admin user?

If you manage more than one account, you'll likely want to create a second admin user who can handle multiple accounts and user management tasks.

## Admin User Capabilities

An admin user can:

1. **Create Accounts** - Set up new analytics accounts
2. **Create Users** - Add new team members
3. **Assign users to accounts** - Manage access permissions

### Step 1: Create Accounts

First, please make sure you have the necessary accounts set up for your organization. Admin users need accounts to manage.

### Step 2: Create Users

Could you add the new user to your SealMetrics organization with the appropriate permissions?

Connect the newly created user to the relevant accounts they should have access to manage.

## When You Need Admin Users

### Multi-Account Management

- **Backup administration**: Having multiple admins for continuity

### Organizational Benefits

- **Distributed management**: Share administrative workload
- **Role specialization**: Different admins for different functions
- **Access control**: Granular permission management
- **Audit trails**: Track administrative actions by user

## Admin User Permissions

### Account Management

- Create new analytics accounts
- Configure account settings

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Principle of least privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Regular review**: Audit admin access quarterly
- **Strong authentication**: Require strong passwords
- **Activity monitoring**: Track admin user actions

### Organizational Structure

- **Clear roles**: Define responsibilities for each admin
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of who has access to what
- **Communication**: Coordinate changes between admins
- **Backup plans**: Ensure multiple admins can handle critical tasks

<Tip>
  Create admin users with specific responsibilities (e.g., one for account creation, another for user management) to maintain clear accountability and reduce security risks
</Tip>

<Note>
  Admin users have significant permissions. Only grant admin access to trusted team members who need these capabilities for their role.
