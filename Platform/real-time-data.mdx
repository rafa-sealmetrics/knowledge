## **Default Data View**

By default, Sealmetrics provides aggregated data up until "yesterday." This means that when you access your analytics dashboard, you will see complete data for all days except the current day.

## **Viewing Real-Time Data**

To access today's data in real-time, you need to:

![Seal Metrics 04 03 2025 04 04 PM(1) Pn](/images/Seal-Metrics-04-03-2025_04_04_PM\(1\).png)

1. Navigate to the calendar feature in your Sealmetrics dashboard.
2. Check the "Real-time Tracking" checkbox.

## **Privacy Regulation Compliance**

Please note that, according to privacy regulations, current-day data in real-time is only accessible by explicitly opting in through the checkbox mentioned above.

This is because real-time data collection requires user consent under current privacy laws. When you enable real-time data viewing, you confirm that you have obtained the necessary consent from your users for this level of data collection.

Sealmetrics' default approach of providing aggregated data until the previous day helps ensure compliance with privacy regulations while still offering valuable insights for your analytics needs.
