# How to change your time zone

Setting the correct time zone ensures that your analytics data is displayed and reported in your local time, making it easier to analyze user behavior patterns and schedule reports.

## How do I change my time zone?

### Step 1: Go to your "Accounts"

Navigate to the **Accounts** section in your SealMetrics dashboard.

### Step 2: Edit the account that you want to change the Timezone

From the accounts list, select and edit the specific account for which you want to modify the time zone settings.

## General Account Settings

In the account settings, you'll find several configuration options:

### Account Information

- **Name**: Your account display name
- **Slug**: URL-friendly account identifier
- **Notification Email Only**: Email for notifications
- **Timezone**: Your local time zone setting

### Time Zone Configuration

The timezone dropdown allows you to select from available time zones:

- **Europe/Madrid**: Central European Time
- **America/New_York**: Eastern Time
- **America/Los_Angeles**: Pacific Time
- **Asia/Tokyo**: Japan Standard Time
- **UTC**: Coordinated Universal Time
- And many more regional options

### Step 3: Select Your Time Zone

Choose your appropriate time zone from the dropdown menu and click **"Update"** to save the changes.

## Why Time Zone Matters

### Accurate Reporting

- **Local time display**: See data in your working hours context
- **Daily reporting**: Proper day boundaries for daily reports
- **Weekly/monthly cycles**: Accurate period calculations
- **Scheduled reports**: Reports generated at correct local times

### Business Intelligence

- **Peak hours analysis**: Understand when your audience is most active
- **Campaign timing**: Schedule campaigns for optimal local times
- **Team coordination**: Align reporting with team schedules
- **International operations**: Coordinate across multiple time zones

## Common Time Zone Scenarios

### Single Location Business

For businesses operating in one location:

- Set time zone to your business location
- All reports will reflect local business hours
- Easy correlation with offline activities
- Simplified team communication

### Multi-Location Operations

For businesses with multiple offices:

- Set primary time zone to headquarters location
- Consider UTC for global coordination
- Document time zone used in reports
- Train team on time zone interpretation

### International Teams

For globally distributed teams:

- Consider using UTC as standard
- Document time zone policy clearly
- Use consistent time zone across all accounts
- Provide training on time interpretation

## Time Zone Best Practices

### Consistency

- **Same time zone across accounts**: Use consistent time zones for related accounts
- **Documentation**: Record which time zone is used for each account
- **Team training**: Ensure team understands time zone settings
- **Regular review**: Verify time zone settings during account audits

### Data Analysis

- **Historical data**: Time zone changes don't affect historical data
- **Peak hours**: Analyze traffic patterns in local time context
- **Campaign scheduling**: Plan campaigns using local time references
- **Report scheduling**: Set automated reports for local business hours

### Coordination

- **Stakeholder communication**: Inform stakeholders of time zone used in reports
- **Meeting scheduling**: Reference report time zones in meetings
- **External reporting**: Clearly state time zone in external reports
- **System integration**: Ensure other systems use compatible time zones

## Technical Considerations

### Data Processing

- **Real-time data**: Immediate reflection of time zone changes
- **Historical data**: Previous data remains in original time zone context
- **Report generation**: New reports use updated time zone
- **API calls**: API responses reflect account time zone settings

### Daylight Saving Time

- **Automatic adjustment**: SealMetrics handles DST transitions automatically
- **Spring forward**: Data gaps during "spring forward" hour
- **Fall back**: Potential duplicate hour during "fall back"
- **International coordination**: Different DST dates across regions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Wrong peak hours**: Check if time zone matches your location
- **Report timing**: Verify automated reports arrive at expected times
- **Data interpretation**: Ensure team understands which time zone is used
- **Campaign timing**: Verify campaigns launch at intended local times

### Solutions

- **Double-check selection**: Verify correct time zone is selected
- **Test reports**: Generate test reports to verify timing
- **Team communication**: Educate team on time zone implications
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of time zone settings

<Tip>
  If you operate in multiple time zones, consider using UTC for consistency and convert to local times when needed for specific analysis.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Time zone changes affect how new data is displayed but don't retroactively change historical data timestamps. Plan time zone changes carefully to maintain data consistency.
