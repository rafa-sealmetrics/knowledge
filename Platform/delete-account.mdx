# How to delete an account

Sometimes, you may need to delete an analytics account that is no longer in use. This guide walks you through the account deletion process and important considerations.

## Before Deleting an Account

### Data Backup Considerations

- **Export analytics data**: Download important reports and data
- **Save configurations**: Document tracking setup and goal configurations
- **Screenshot reports**: Save visual reports for historical reference
- **Conversion data**: Export conversion and revenue data
- **Custom configurations**: Document any custom tracking implementations

### Team Communication

- **Notify stakeholders**: Inform team members about the deletion
- **Transfer responsibilities**: Reassign account management duties
- **Update documentation**: Remove references to the deleted account
- **Access review**: Ensure no critical processes depend on the account

### Alternative Options

Before permanent deletion, consider:

- **Account archiving**: Keep data but stop active tracking
- **User removal**: Remove users instead of deleting the account
- **Data export**: Export data and then delete
- **Temporary suspension**: Pause tracking temporarily

## Account Deletion Process

### Step 1: Access Account Settings

1. Navigate to the account you want to delete
2. Go to account settings or administration area
3. Look for "Account Management" or "Danger Zone" section
4. Find the account deletion option

### Step 2: Confirm Deletion Requirements

- **Admin permissions**: Ensure you have administrator access
- **Outstanding billing**: Resolve any billing issues first
- **Data export**: Complete any necessary data exports
- **Team notification**: Confirm team members are aware

### Step 3: Initiate Deletion Process

1. Click "Delete Account" or similar option
2. Read the deletion warnings carefully
3. Type the account name or confirmation phrase
4. Confirm you understand the consequences
5. Submit the deletion request

### Step 4: Verification and Processing

- **Email confirmation**: Check email for deletion confirmation
- **Processing time**: Allow time for deletion to complete
- **Access removal**: Verify account no longer appears in dashboard
- **Final verification**: Confirm deletion was successful

## What Gets Deleted

### Analytics Data

- **All historical data**: Page views, conversions, revenue data
- **Reports and dashboards**: Custom reports and configurations
- **Goal configurations**: Conversion goals and tracking setup
- **Traffic source data**: Referrer and campaign attribution

### Account Configuration

- **Tracking settings**: All tracking configurations
- **User access**: Team member access to the account
- **Integration settings**: Third-party integrations
- **Custom dimensions**: Any custom tracking parameters
- **API access**: API tokens specific to the account

### What Is NOT Deleted

- **Organization account**: Your main SealMetrics account remains
- **Other accounts**: Other analytics accounts are unaffected
- **Billing information**: Billing details remain for other accounts
- **User accounts**: Team member accounts remain active
- **Exported data**: Previously exported data remains accessible

## Consequences of Deletion

### Immediate Effects

- **Data loss**: All analytics data becomes permanently inaccessible
- **Tracking stops**: Website tracking ceases immediately
- **Report unavailability**: All reports become unavailable
- **API access revoked**: API calls for the account will fail
- **Dashboard removal**: Account disappears from dashboard

### Long-term Implications

- **Historical analysis**: Cannot perform historical trend analysis
- **Compliance issues**: May affect regulatory compliance requirements
- **Business continuity**: Impacts ongoing analytics and reporting
- **Data recovery**: No way to recover deleted data
- **Team access**: Team members lose access to account data

## Data Recovery Options

### Prevention is Key

- **Regular backups**: Export data regularly before deletion
- **Multiple formats**: Export in different formats (CSV, PDF, etc.)
- **Cloud storage**: Store exports in secure cloud storage
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of key insights

### Limited Recovery Possibilities

- **Grace period**: Some systems offer limited recovery time
- **Support assistance**: Contact support immediately if deletion was accidental
- **Backup restoration**: May be possible within very short timeframe
- **Partial recovery**: Some aggregated data might be recoverable

### Post-Deletion Alternatives

- **Historical reports**: Use previously exported reports
- **Aggregated insights**: Rely on saved insights and summaries
- **Comparative analysis**: Use industry benchmarks for comparison
- **Fresh start**: Begin new tracking with lessons learned

## Best Practices

### Before Deletion

- **Comprehensive export**: Export all relevant data formats
- **Documentation**: Document key insights and findings
- **Team training**: Train team on using exported data
- **Process documentation**: Document deletion decision rationale

### Decision Making

- **Multiple approvals**: Require multiple stakeholder approvals
- **Waiting period**: Implement mandatory waiting period before deletion
- **Alternative evaluation**: Thoroughly evaluate alternatives
- **Impact assessment**: Assess business impact of data loss

### Post-Deletion

- **Verify deletion**: Confirm deletion completed successfully
- **Remove tracking codes**: Remove tracking code from websites
- **Update processes**: Update any processes that referenced the account
- **Learn from experience**: Document lessons learned

## When Account Deletion Makes Sense

### Appropriate Scenarios

- **Discontinued websites**: Site is permanently offline
- **Completed projects**: Temporary campaigns or projects ended
- **Business closure**: Part of business permanently closed
- **Data consolidation**: Merging multiple accounts into one
- **Compliance requirements**: Legal requirement to delete data

### Consider Alternatives Instead

- **Temporary suspension**: Website temporarily offline
- **Seasonal business**: Seasonal or cyclical business patterns
- **Team changes**: Staff changes but business continues
- **Cost concerns**: Explore downgrade options instead
- **Technical issues**: Tracking problems that can be fixed

<Note>
  Account deletion is permanent and irreversible. All analytics data will be permanently lost. Ensure you have exported all necessary data before proceeding with deletion.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Instead of deleting immediately, consider removing the tracking code and keeping the account inactive for a month. This gives you time to reconsider without permanent data loss. \</Note\>
