## Using subdomain differentiation in URL analytics

Subdomain differentiation allows you to analyze different parts of your website infrastructure separately, providing deeper insights into how different subdomains perform and contribute to your overall business goals.

## Understanding Subdomain Analytics

### What Are Subdomains?

- **Definition**: Prefixes to your main domain ([blog.example.com](http://blog.example.com), [shop.example.com](http://shop.example.com))
- **Purpose**: Organize different sections or functions of your website
- **Examples**: www, blog, shop, app, support, api, cdn
- **Technical structure**: Separate DNS entries pointing to different servers
- **User experience**: Often feel like different sites to users

### Why Analyze Subdomains Separately?

- **Performance comparison**: Compare how different subdomains perform
- **Content strategy**: Understand which content areas drive most engagement
- **User journey mapping**: Track how users move between subdomains
- **Resource allocation**: Make informed decisions about subdomain investment
- **Technical optimization**: Identify subdomain-specific performance issues

## Common Subdomain Structures

### E-commerce Businesses

```
www.example.com        → Main marketing site
shop.example.com       → E-commerce store
blog.example.com       → Content marketing
support.example.com    → Customer service
account.example.com    → User dashboard
```

### SaaS Companies

```
www.example.com        → Marketing and landing pages
app.example.com        → Main application
docs.example.com       → Documentation
blog.example.com       → Content and resources
status.example.com     → Service status page
```

### Media and Publishing

```
www.example.com        → Homepage and main content
news.example.com       → News and articles
video.example.com      → Video content
podcasts.example.com   → Podcast platform
community.example.com  → User community
```

## Setting Up Subdomain Differentiation

### Automatic Detection

SealMetrics automatically recognizes and differentiates subdomains:

- **Hostname parsing**: Extracts subdomain from page URLs
- **Automatic grouping**: Groups pages by subdomain
- **Real-time processing**: Immediate subdomain classification
- **Historical data**: Applies to both new and historical data
- **No configuration needed**: Works out of the box

### Manual Configuration

For custom subdomain analysis:

- **Custom grouping**: Group related subdomains together
- **Exclude subdomains**: Filter out CDN or system subdomains
- **Rename subdomains**: Use friendly names for reporting
- **Merge subdomains**: Combine similar subdomains for analysis
- **Priority setting**: Set primary subdomains for focused analysis

## Analytics Benefits

### Performance Comparison

- **Traffic distribution**: See which subdomains receive most traffic
- **Conversion rates**: Compare conversion performance across subdomains
- **Engagement metrics**: Analyze time on site, bounce rate by subdomain
- **User behavior**: Understand how users interact with each subdomain
- **Technical performance**: Monitor loading speeds and technical metrics

### Business Intelligence

- **Content effectiveness**: Identify most valuable content areas
- **User journey insights**: Track cross-subdomain navigation patterns
- **Revenue attribution**: Understand which subdomains drive revenue
- **Marketing ROI**: Measure marketing effectiveness by subdomain
- **Resource optimization**: Allocate resources based on performance data

### Strategic Planning

- **Investment decisions**: Focus development on high-performing subdomains
