# How to avoid conversions being attributed to "payment" in SealMetrics

When users complete a purchase on your website and are redirected to a **payment gateway** (like Stripe, PayPal, Redsys, etc.), they temporarily leave your site. When they return to your **thank you page**, Sealmetrics detects this as a new session.

If the payment gateway domain is not on our predefined list, the session is attributed to a **source = payment**.

This means:

✅ The conversion is tracked

❌ But the original source (Google Ads, Facebook, Email, etc.) is lost

That’s a problem if you care about real attribution — and we assume you do.

## **Why Sealmetrics Attributes “Payment” as a Source**

Sealmetrics is privacy-first and doesn’t rely on cookies or fingerprinting. Instead, we identify sessions based on signals like browser, OS, screen size, and timestamps.

So when the user leaves your site and comes back from a third-party domain (like [secure.paymentsite.com](http://secure.paymentsite.com)), it’s treated as a **new session**, unless:

1. The domain is on our **known list of payment providers**
2. Or you implement a **referrer bypass system**

## **When Does This Happen?**

You’ll typically see conversions from “source = payment” when:

- The payment provider uses a redirect flow
- The return to the thank you page creates a new session
- The referrer is the payment provider, not the original traffic source

Example:

1. A user clicks on a Google Ads campaign
2. They add items to cart → proceed to checkout
3. They pay via [payments.xyz.com](http://payments.xyz.com)
4. They’re redirected to /thank-you

   → Sealmetrics detects referrer = [payments.xyz.com](http://payments.xyz.com)

   → Source is recorded as payment instead of Google Ads

Instead of adding "[consentmode.sealmetrics.net](http://consentmode.sealmetrics.net)" **add the Payment Gateway Domain.**
